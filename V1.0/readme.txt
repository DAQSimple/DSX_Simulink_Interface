To add DSX Library to your Simulink:

in matlab console type:

	>> pathtool

Locate your V1.0 folder and select "Add Folder" (or add with subfolders). You can also chose a parent folder and select "Add with Subfolders".

Save and close pathtool.

Next, open and run the slblocks.m script in the V1.0 folder.

Lastly, open Simulink, and next open the Library Browser. On the left side of the browser, (over any library text), and right click and refresh the library browser.

The DSX Library should then show up in the library browser, and is ready for use. (i hope)
