To add DSX Library to your Simulink:

in matlab console type:

	>> pathtool

Select "Add folder with subfolders", then locate and select your DSX Library folder.

Apply and save and all the good stuff and close pathtool.


Next, open and run the slblocks.m script in the DSX Library folder.


If the DSX library doesn't already show up in the Simulink library, on the left side of the browser, (over any library text) right click and refresh the library browser.

The DSX Library should then show up in the library browser you're good to go.
