UPDATE LOG:

3/24/2021:
	- test scripts added
	- trying to:
		- send command (asking for ping back)
		- read ping from DSX
		- show ping

	- Write blocks are are functional (Digital, PWM, Servo)

	- ^ that is if matlab is working properly with Arduino

3/27/2021: 
	- Digital Write on hold, debugging right now

	- Digital Read, Analog Read working
	- Succesfully reading serial commands into a buffer where blocks look for their respective pings
	- To use V2.0, reinitialize the DSX library using the steps in the readme
