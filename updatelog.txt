UPDATE LOG:

3/24/2021:
	- test scripts added
	- trying to:
		- send command (asking for ping back)
		- read ping from DSX
		- show ping

	- Write blocks are are functional (Digital, PWM, Servo)

	- ^ that is if matlab is working properly with Arduino

3/27/2021: 
	- Digital Read, Analog Read working (haven't tested encoder read, should work, LMK)
    - All writes should work
    - DSX_Serial_Send / DSX_Serial_Receive are there but I'm not sure if they work, theyre not a priority

	- Succesfully reading serial commands into a buffer where blocks look for their respective pings

	- To use V2.0, reinitialize the DSX library using the steps in the readme
